# About This Journal

## Who is this for?

I'll be totally honest&mdash;I'm not sure! It's for anyone who would like to keep a journal but maybe struggled with other methods in the past.

## Do I have to be a developer/computer whiz to use this?

I hope not! It's definitely geared a little more toward people with technical backgrounds, or who are at least a little familiar with the command line and VS Code, but I tried to make it as easy as I could for just about anyone to pick up.

## Why should I use this?

Well, for me, not only did it help me actually keep a journal more regularly and successfully, it also helped me learn a lot more about the tool I've been using 8+ hours a day every day for several years now. I have a better understanding of VS Code and its capabilities now than I did even just a month ago, and the more I use my journal, the more I explore and learn.

But that's all secondary; to be perfectly honest, I think many people would benefit from keeping a journal, and that you should use any tool at your disposal to help you do that.

I imagine it might also be helpful for those of you who want to learn more about code/programming and the tools involved. The more I write in these guides and documentation files, the more I realize that a lot of this is more about "how to use VS Code" than it is about "how to use this journal." I can say that all of this has helped me learn more in part because it removed the heavy lifting of needing to actually write *code* - which requires one to have an idea and goals and whatnot - so I could instead focus more on the tool and its capabilities.

For me, all of this made keeping a journal fun, easy, accessible and interesting. Maybe it could do the same for you, too.
