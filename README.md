# VSCode Journal

## What is this?

A template to facilitate keeping a journal using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [NodeJS/npm](https://nodejs.org), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

## Isn't that...a bit much?

Definitely!

## How do I get started?

You will need to install:

- [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)

Next, download the template. Either click `Use this Template` on the GitHub page to make a new GitHub repository using the template, or just click the `Code` dropdown, download the `ZIP`, and worry about all the Git stuff later.

Extract the `.zip` file somewhere on your computer, then open VS Code.

In VS Code, go to `File -> Open Folder...` and open the folder you just extracted from the `.zip`.

Now for the technical part - at the top of VS Code, select `Terminal -> New Terminal`. Inside the terminal window that opens, type:

`npm install`

You should see a bunch of text flash by on the screen. Unless you see `Error` anywhere, you're good.

Now you're ready to make a new entry! In that same terminal window, type:

`npm run new`

This will create a new [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file for today's date and open it in VS Code for you to edit! Get writing!
